# Balatro AP Mod

This is a Mod for [Balatro](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/) that provides Integration for [Archipelago Multi World](https://archipelago.gg)

# Gameplay

After generating a seed, every joker, voucher, booster pack, consumable (spectral, tarot, planet) is locked. You can unlock them by finding them in the world as Archipelago items. 

Locations(Checks) are beating a boss blind at a specific ante with a specific deck at a specific stake. You can limit the amount of stakes and decks in the yaml. There are also buyable checks in the shop and consumable items that are checks. 

There are bonus items, for example permanent bonus hand, permanent bonus starting money and more.
There are a few traps, for example lose one hand (for the current run), lose all money, make a random joker perishable and more. 

There are a lot more options, just check out the yaml that is bundled with the latest [release](https://github.com/BurndiL/BalatroAP/releases).

# Installation

Here's a [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/XnEvgEOswpk) I made sometime if any step of the installation is unclear.

You will need [Steamodded (Alpha)](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded). **MAKE SURE TO DOWNLOAD THE ALPHA**. Follow their [installation guide](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki).

After that, you will also have to download `lua51.7z` from [lua apclient](https://github.com/black-sliver/lua-apclientpp/releases). 

From the `lua51.7z` extract the file `lua51-clang64-dynamic > lua-apclientpp.dll` and put it into your Balatro installation folder (the same folder you put Lovely's `version.dll`). 

Your Balatro Folder should look something like this (highlighted files should be there):

## Installing the mod

To install the mod create a new folder in `%AppData%/Roaming/Balatro/Mods/` called `BalatroAP` and put the files from this repository in there. You can get those from `BalatroAP.zip` in the latest release. 

Your Mods folder should look something like this:

And the inside of the BalatroAP folder should look something like this:

You should be good to go then! You can start the game normally over Steam and it should load the mod. If there are any issues, consider going to the [Archipelago After Dark Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fqvNCCRsu4) server, there is a Balatro thread in future-game-design. 

## Connecting

In Balatro you can simply connect by selecting the profile "Archipelago" in the profile selector, then put in your connection info.
It is adviced that you backup your existing save files, even though they should not be modified or deleted by this mod. 

## Linux using Proton via Steam

After installing Lovely you will need to edit your wine prefix to allow Lovely to load. This can be done any time after you place the `version.dll` file in your folder. Vanilla Balatro will always launch if you do not do this.

1. Download and install [Protontricks](https://github.com/Matoking/protontricks).
2. Open Protontricks.
3. If necessary, choose between Native and Flatpak Steam (I use flatpak for Balatro).

   Note: If you receive an error, you may have to run the command `export PROTON_VERSION='Proton Experimental'` and restart Protontricks.
   
7. Select the default wineprefix and click OK.
